## Dependencies Issue Resolution

The CI pipeline is failing due to missing dependencies in the package-lock.json file. The following dependencies need to be properly installed and synchronized:

```
Missing dependencies:
- @testing-library/jest-dom@6.6.3
- @adobe/css-tools@4.4.3
- chalk@3.0.0
- css.escape@1.5.1
- dom-accessibility-api@0.6.3
- redent@3.0.0
- strip-indent@3.0.0
- min-indent@1.0.1
```

To resolve this issue:

1. Run `npm install` locally to update package-lock.json with the new dependencies
2. Commit the updated package-lock.json file
3. Push the changes to the feature/authorization-and-authentication branch
4. Re-run the CI pipeline

This needs to be fixed before proceeding with the styling updates to ensure a stable build environment.
