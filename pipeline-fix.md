To fix the pipeline failure, the following dependencies need to be added to package.json and the lock file needs to be updated:

```
@testing-library/jest-dom@6.6.3
@adobe/css-tools@4.4.3
chalk@3.0.0
css.escape@1.5.1
dom-accessibility-api@0.6.3
redent@3.0.0
strip-indent@3.0.0
min-indent@1.0.1
```

Steps to fix:
1. Add these dependencies to package.json
2. Run `npm install` to update the lock file
3. Commit both the updated package.json and package-lock.json files

Once these dependencies are properly installed and the lock file is updated, the pipeline should pass successfully.

Note: These dependencies appear to be related to testing and styling functionality, which aligns with the task of fixing styling issues across auth pages.
