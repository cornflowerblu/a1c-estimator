# Database Refactoring Plan for A1C Estimator

## Overview

This document outlines our plan to refactor the database implementation in the A1C Estimator project. We're experiencing issues with the current Prisma setup that are causing build failures and integration problems. This plan will guide us through analyzing the original implementation, deciding on an approach, and creating an implementation plan.

## 1. Analysis of Original Implementation (Commit 468e83c3c8f5d9de102141fb05bb63a4a623cc5e)

### Tasks:
- [ ] Check out the original commit to analyze the initial database structure
- [ ] Review type definitions created by the agents
- [ ] Compare with our current models to identify similarities and differences
- [ ] Document key data structures and relationships
- [ ] Identify what worked well in the original implementation
- [ ] Note any limitations or issues in the original approach

### Key Questions:
- How close are the original type definitions to our current models?
- What data structures were prioritized in the POC?
- What database technology was used in the original implementation?
- How was authentication handled in relation to the database?

## 2. Database Approach Decision

Based on the analysis of the original implementation and our current needs, we'll decide on the most appropriate database approach.

### Options to Consider:
- [ ] Continue with Prisma but simplify the configuration
- [ ] Switch to a simpler ORM solution
- [ ] Use a direct database driver without an ORM
- [ ] Implement a temporary solution using localStorage for rapid development
- [ ] Consider a hybrid approach with simple storage for core features and more complex storage for advanced features

### Decision Criteria:
- Development speed and simplicity
- Type safety and integration with TypeScript
- Scalability for future features
- Authentication integration requirements
- Data migration capabilities
- Offline support requirements

## 3. Implementation Plan

Once we've decided on an approach, we'll create a detailed implementation plan.

### Plan Components:
- [ ] Define the database schema/model structure
- [ ] Outline the data access layer architecture
- [ ] Create a migration strategy from current implementation
- [ ] Establish testing approach for database functionality
- [ ] Set up authentication integration
- [ ] Define backup and data persistence strategy
- [ ] Document the implementation for team reference

### Implementation Phases:
1. **Core Data Structures** - Implement the essential models first (glucose readings, runs, months)
2. **Authentication Integration** - Connect user accounts to data
3. **Advanced Features** - Add support for analytics, sharing, etc.
4. **Optimization** - Improve performance and add caching where needed

## Next Steps

1. Check out commit 468e83c3c8f5d9de102141fb05bb63a4a623cc5e
2. Analyze the type definitions and database approach
3. Document findings in this file
4. Make a decision on the database approach
5. Create the detailed implementation plan
6. Begin implementation according to the defined phases
