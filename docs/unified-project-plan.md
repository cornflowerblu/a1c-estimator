# A1C Estimator - Unified Project Plan

## Project Overview

The A1C Estimator is a modern web application designed to help people with diabetes track their blood glucose levels and estimate their A1C values. This project is a modernization of an existing application, enhancing it with improved architecture, data management, user experience, and additional features.

## Background

The original A1C Estimator was a web-based tool that allowed users to:
- Input blood glucose readings at different times of day
- Calculate estimated A1C based on average glucose values
- Track data through "RUN" cycles (collections of readings) and "MONTH" cycles (collections of runs)
- Store data locally in the browser

While functional, the original application had limitations including:
- Insecure local storage of health data
- Limited code organization and maintainability
- No mobile optimization
- Minimal data visualization
- No integration with external systems

## Project Goals

1. **Modernize Architecture**: Rebuild using a modular, maintainable architecture with Nx workspace
2. **Enhance Data Security**: Move from localStorage to a proper database with user authentication
3. **Improve User Experience**: Create a responsive, accessible, and intuitive interface
4. **Add Advanced Features**: Implement data visualization, analytics, and integration capabilities
5. **Enable Cross-Platform Access**: Support web and mobile platforms with a unified codebase
