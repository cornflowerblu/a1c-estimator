# Simplified Authentication Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a simplified approach to authentication for the A1C Estimator application using AWS Cognito.

## Authentication Strategy

We will implement a streamlined authentication flow using AWS Cognito as our identity provider:

1. **User Pool Setup**:
   - Single AWS Cognito User Pool
   - Email as the primary identifier
   - Standard password policies
   - Email verification required

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Direct integration with Cognito API (no hosted UI)
   - JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
   - Server-side authentication handling

3. **User Data Management**:
   - Store Cognito user ID in our database
   - Link all user data to this ID
   - Maintain minimal user profile information

## Implementation Steps

### 1. AWS Cognito Configuration

- Create User Pool with basic settings
- Configure app client with appropriate permissions
- Set up necessary triggers and Lambda functions

### 2. Backend Integration

- Create authentication API endpoints
- Implement token management
- Set up protected route middleware

### 3. Frontend Components

- Simple login/registration forms
- Profile management page
- Password reset functionality

## Security Measures

- HTTPS for all communications
- HTTP-only cookies for token storage
- CSRF protection
- Proper token validation

## User Experience

- Clean, minimal authentication forms
- Clear error messages
- Seamless transition from auth to app
- Remember me functionality

## Timeline

- **Day 1-2**: AWS Cognito setup and configuration
- **Day 3-5**: Backend API implementation
- **Day 6-7**: Frontend integration and testing

This simplified approach focuses on getting a secure, functional authentication system in place quickly, with room for future enhancements as needed.
