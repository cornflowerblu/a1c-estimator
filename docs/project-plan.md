2. **Data Persistence and Management**
   - Local storage of glucose readings and calculated A1C values
   - Ability to save/load data to files for backup and portability
   - Copy functionality between different RUN cycles
   - Clear data options (individual RUNs or all data)

3. **Flexible Input Options**
   - Support for different meal-related readings (pre/post meals, bedtime, wakeup)
   - Ability to add comments and meal information alongside readings
   - Time-based tracking with AM/PM format
   - Unit conversion between A1C percentage and average glucose (AG) in mg/dl

4. **Educational Content**
   - Comprehensive instructions on how to use the tool
   - Educational information about A1C, diabetes management, and food recommendations
   - Scientific references and explanations of the A1C calculation methodology
   - Clear definitions of terms like RUN, MONTH, AG, and A1C

5. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Simple form-based input system
   - Date and time tracking for readings
   - Visual feedback on saved data
   - Print functionality for sharing with healthcare providers

## Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Modern Data Architecture**
   - Move from local storage to a proper database for better data security and reliability
   - Implement user accounts for accessing data across devices
   - Create a proper API for data management instead of direct localStorage manipulation
   - Enable cloud backup and synchronization

2. **Mobile App Development**
   - Create native mobile apps for iOS and Android
   - Implement push notifications for reminders to take readings
   - Add integration with health apps (Apple Health, Google Fit)
   - Enable offline functionality with synchronization when online

3. **Enhanced Analytics**
   - Provide visual graphs and trends of glucose readings over time
   - Add predictive analytics to forecast A1C changes based on current patterns
   - Implement pattern recognition to identify problematic times of day or meal responses
   - Generate personalized insights and recommendations

4. **Integration Capabilities**
   - Connect with glucose monitoring devices for automatic data import
   - Enable sharing with healthcare providers through secure channels
   - Integrate with meal tracking and nutrition apps
   - Support for exporting data in standard medical formats

5. **Improved User Experience**
   - Redesign with modern UI/UX principles
   - Add customizable dashboards
   - Implement dark mode and accessibility features
   - Create guided onboarding for new users
